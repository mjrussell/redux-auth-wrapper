## Custom Release

yarn build && yarn build:copyFiles && yarn dist

## Version 3
Version 3.x has the same external API as version 2, however it only supports React >= 16.3. It is also tested with react-router v5 and [connected-react-router](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router) which replaced [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux).

## Version 2

Version 2.x is a big internal rewrite! It provides a massive increase in flexibility when using redux-auth-wrapper and also introduces some breaking changes. See the [Migration Guide](https://mjrussell.github.io/redux-auth-wrapper/docs/Migrating.html) for more details if coming from 1.x. Or check out the [Getting Started](https://mjrussell.github.io/redux-auth-wrapper/docs/Getting-Started/Overview.html) guide if you've never used redux-auth-wrapper before.
